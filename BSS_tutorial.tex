\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
BioSimSpace is an interoperable molecular simulation framework providing a uniform Python API for common molecular simulation packages such as Gromacs, NAMD, SOMD, and AMBER. This tutorial introduces different aspects of the API from basic simulation setup to more advanced types of simulations such as alchemical free energy simulations, as well as metadynamics simulations.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}

Tutorials should endeavor to cover the specific task at hand, and also highlight how the steps might need to be modified (or additional care might need to be taken at particular points) to handle more general cases.

The scope of the tutorial, as well as the expected proficiencies / outcomes for researchers who complete the tutorial, should be clearly defined.
This will often happen in a specific section or subsection in the article itself.

%%%%% Prerequisites

\section{Prerequisites}
\label{sec:prerequisites}
The user is expected to have installed BioSimSpace version 2019.2 

\subsection{Background knowledge}
\label{subsec:background}
The tutorials can be run in different ways, either as command line tools from a Unix terminal, or as part of a Jupyter notebook. Familiarity with either or both is assumed. While BSS provides a high level layer around molecular simualtion software it is still useful to have basic ideas on how molecular dynamics simulations work. As a starting point we recommend

\section{Basic BioSimSpace tutorials}
\label{sec:basic_tutorial}
BioSimSpace has a very versatile Python API that allows not just to write typical molecular dynamics simulation and analysis workflow, but can also be used for simple tasks such as converting between different MD file types. In the basic tutorial section file conversions, molecular simualtion setup, including parametrisation, minimisation and equilibration as well as running MD simulations will be covered.
